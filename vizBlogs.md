## A visualization I found recently that I disliked
I found this data visualization on the Wall Street Journal. 
![Web capture_10-10-2022_04257_graphics wsj com](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/114178136/194805121-7aff6336-04ab-4de9-8db5-ec44181f2801.jpeg)

I dislike this visualization because for a rather simple reason. I understand that the countries are in order of largest to smallest carbon emitters, but the groupings make it seem as if the EU and India had something in common other than that, and especially for the last group. There's no way they couldn't have done this without grouping them in that way.
