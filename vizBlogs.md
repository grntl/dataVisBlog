## A visualization I found recently that I disliked
I found this data visualization on from a [Wall Street Journal article about carbon emissions](http://graphics.wsj.com/climate-talks/). 
![Web capture_10-10-2022_04257_graphics wsj com](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/114178136/194805121-7aff6336-04ab-4de9-8db5-ec44181f2801.jpeg)

I dislike this visualization because for a rather simple reason. I understand that the countries are in order of largest to smallest carbon emitters, but the groupings make it seem as if the EU and India had something in common other than that, and especially for the last group. There's no way they couldn't have done this without grouping them in that way. Also, I'm fairly confused at how they are ordered the way they are when Indonesia's units are lower than some below it in the rankings. It is cool to put the visualization in the shape of the countries, but I would have preferred the squares just be stacked up in nice bars in order of largest emitters to smallest. It's simpler and easier to understand.

I found this from a [New York Times article about abortion costs](https://archive.ph/NKrTS). I liked this visualization because it kept the y axis consistent throughout every single graph despite the fact that there were many of them and that one even went off the chart. In my opinion, that's preferable to having a different y-axis for every single graph because then it would be hard to evaluate or compare across graphs. 

A bit of code that might produce the same thing with two graphs would be:
```
clinic1Graph %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = year) + 
  geom_line(aes(y = abortionClinic1)) +
  ylim(0, 1000)
  
clinic2Graph %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = year) +
  geom_line(aes(y = abortionClinic2)) + 
  ylim(0, 1000)
```
This way, there are two graphs. I got the idea for this code from [stackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/30375600/how-to-plot-multiple-lines-for-each-column-of-a-data-matrix-against-one-column), because I realized that the table for this data would have to be structured kind of oddly. The left hand column would be a sort of index by year, and the columns would be each abortion clinic, with the values being the prices. I'd obviously have to be selective about the years by picking specifically the 2021-2022 row, but I'm not sure how to do that yet.
## My own data visualization
I found a dataset that was put on tidytuesdays on GitHub in 2021 about [transit costs](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/data/2021/2021-01-05/readme.md). I'm very into transit, and it's a huge problem in America that transit costs an insane amount to buildâ€”it means we end up with some of the worst public transit in the world, or none at all.

First, I did ```head(transit_cost)``` in order to see what the table looked like. I could see that it had various cities as rows, with their country as a variable, along with the cost per kilometer.

Then I cleaned the data by removing NAs. 

```
transitCleaned <- na.omit(transit_cost)
```
In order to do the country-by-country analysis I wanted to do, I needed to find out what countries there were in the database. I used the code below to find all the unique values of in the 'country' column of the datatable and also put them into a vector that I could utilize later.
```
countries <- c(unique(transitCleaned$country))
countries
```
Then I made a function where if I gave it a country, it would go and find the average value of the cost per kilometer from that country by finding all the entries in the database from that country and averaging their values in the cost per kilometer column.
```
countryAvg <- function(x) {
  tally <- 0
  totalCost <- 0
  for (i in 1:nrow(transitCleaned)) {
    if (transitCleaned$country[i] == x){
      totalCost <- totalCost + as.numeric(transitCleaned$cost_km_millions[i])
      tally <- tally + 1
    }
  }
  return(totalCost / tally)
}
```

I made an empty vector that I would fill with the averages for every country. I used a for loop to iterate through the vector of countries I had made earlier and call on the function for every one of the countries. Each iteration appends the average cost per kilometer of that country onto the empty vector so that by the time the for loop as gone through every country, the vector should now be filled with the average cost per kilometer for every country.
```
averages <- c()
for (c in countries) {
  averages <- append(averages, countryAvg(c))
}
averages
```
I combined the countries vector and the averages together into one new dataframe that I would work with.
```
avgCostCountry <- data.frame(countries, averages)
avgCostCountry
```
Then I made a bar graph with the data.
```{r}
avgCostCountry %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = as.factor(countries), y = averages)) +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1)) +
  geom_col(stat = 'identity') +
  labs(x = "Country", y = "Average Real Cost in Millions of USD")
``` 
Unfortunately, I cannot understand for the life of me how to shift the axis so that the country labels are actually aligned with their bars. But if you inspect closely, you can see how the column for US is just far beyond any other country.
