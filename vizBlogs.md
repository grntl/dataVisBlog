## A visualization I found recently that I disliked
I found this data visualization on the Wall Street Journal.

I dislike this visualization because for a rather simple reason. I understand that the countries are in order of largest to smallest carbon emitters, but the groupings make it seem as if the EU and India had something in common other than that, and especially for the last group. There's no way they couldn't have done this without grouping them in that way. Also, I'm fairly confused at how they are ordered the way they are when Indonesia's units are lower than some below it in the rankings. It is cool to put the visualization in the shape of the countries, but I would have preferred the squares just be stacked up in nice bars in order of largest emitters to smallest. It's simpler and easier to understand.
