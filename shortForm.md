We are interested broadly in how civil society and government censorship efforts are related, interact, and change over time and region. The data we use to explore these two factors is from the [VDEM database](https://www.v-dem.net/) measuring various aspects of democracy. 

Civil society and government censorship efforts are very important to political society. Civil society is defined as the space between the state and private life where people form communities and groups to pursue their interests, like unions, religious groups, interest groups, and so on. Government censorship efforts is the degree to which the government tries to censor print or broadcast media. These variables differ in that a society can still have civil society where people meet and advocate their interests to those in power through direct contact, and yet government censorship will not affect civil society unless groups attempt to put their interests into some form of media. Nevertheless, the latter scenario does often happen. Accordingly, we would like to use visual analysis of the data to observe their relationship. In this dataset, civil society is measured on a 0-1 scale, and government censorship efforts are measured on a 0 to 4 scale where 0 is most severe and 4 is the least (according to the codebook).

In the following figure, government censorship efforts and civil society are plotted against each other on a scatterplot. We only use the data since 2010 for increased visual clarity, as any association between the two variables is not immediately affected by time.

From this visualization, we can see that some of the darker dots, where the European countries are, are concentrated towards the upper right corner. Those countries have had less government censorship and better civil societies. Towards the bottom left, the dots tend to be greener, so they represent countries from Africa and Asia. These countries are worse in terms of censorship and civil society. Overall, we can see that civil society and (less) government censorship effort is clearly positively associated.

Next, we would like to observe how these variables have changed over time. The following graph shows each region plotted separately for the two variables since 1930. We chose 1930 as the start point since many countries that existed prior to 1930 but no longer might mess up the data. To make sure the y-axis matched for both graphs, we normalized the data for government censorship effort into a 0-1 scale.

The clarity of this graph is not ideal. However, we can still learn a few things from it. First, Europe tends to be better on both measures, the Americas near the middle, and the rest near the bottom. Second, we can also see that around 1940 and 1990 there were significant shifts. These coincide with World War II and the end of the Cold War respectively. 

For more clarity, we break the data down into individual regions.

We can gain several interesting insights from this visualization. The most important is that gov. censorship efforts tends to fluctuate less than civil society. The second is that in many regions, we can observe a decoupling of civil society from gov. censorship efforts where they had previously tracked each other tightly. One potential theory for this is that the Internet and its various forms of communication have made it harder for the government to control civil society through just media censorship. This would require data analysis outside of the scope of this analysis to confirm.

The last visualization is a dotplot showing the difference in distribution of countries between the 1950 and 2020. 1950 was chosen as that is around when the post-war era started, and is bookended by 2020, a year close to the present-day. These two dates help us see whether things improved aside from the most immediate effects and fluctuations of World War II.

This graph mostly corroborates what the previous graphs have shown, such as the improvement on both measures, and how government censorship effort fluctuates less. Note that some aspects of this graph are problematic, such as the binwidth, which is set at 1/30 and does not correspond to individual countries. Other binwidths were tested but only decreased visual clarity.

To conclude, we can observe that the two variables are correlated with each other, and that certain regions like Europe fare better than others, but that in many places, the two are starting to decouple.

## October 24

Public transit is a cornerstone of urban communities. It allows residents of a city to commute to work without having to be in a car on the street. This is important for many reasons. First, the environmental benefits of having less car trips is huge. Not only is it better for the climate, but it makes for a better city in terms of noise, pollution, and safety. Second, public transit allows many people to save money on transit because they do not have to buy a car. 

Much of the conversation around public transit surrounds its ridership. The ridership is often used to justify funding or building transit in the first place. It becomes a contentious topic among both politicians and stakeholders, with those who are wary of giving more funding to public transit pointing to low ridership and such. While this potentially gets the causation backwards, as increased ridership is often driven by a well-funded, effective public transit system, ridership might still persist in high numbers despite a poorly funded public transit system. In that case, the case is even stronger for better public transit funding. 

Recently, ridership come under scrutiny, not only because the adoption of public transit is increasingly considered a key part of a possible solution to climate change, but also because the COVID-19 pandemic reduced ridership immensely, while the fixed costs of system maintenance was still being paid out from city budgets. [As evidence for this, the federal government helped to fund public transit systems that were experiencing revenue gaps](https://www.transit.dot.gov/coronavirus). 
To investigate this issue, I used the official [CTA dataset “CTA – Ridership – ‘L’ Station Entries – Daily Totals"](https://data.cityofchicago.org/Transportation/CTA-Ridership-L-Station-Entries-Daily-Totals/5neh-572f). The dataset consists of five columns: the station ID, the station name, date, the type of day (weekday, Saturday, Sunday/holiday), and also the number of rides. This data is fairly reputable because it is collected by the official agency itself. The data goes from the beginning of 2001 up through July, 2022. 
I want to use this data to visualize and understand how ridership has historically been on the CTA, and how it has looked in recent years. To begin, I made a bar plot of the ridership total for each year. 

![This is a bar plot graph showing ridership by year](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/114178136/197940422-06c31da6-3350-478c-a079-215a0ace58a4.png)

This aggregates data from every single station for every single day of that year and adds them together. After making this graph, it is very clear just how much COVID-19 affected ridership. However, it has also been increasing since 2020, as the data for 2022 only goes through July, yet the ridership is about three-quarters of the way to 2021’s ridership total. 

We can look at this in more detail by looking at monthly ridership over the same time period. 

![This is a line graph showing ridership by month, from 2001 to 2022](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/114178136/197941144-c198938f-0d8a-4186-9e1a-3aa6da187cd4.png)

Here, you can see how ridership fluctuates each year, such as how ridership tends to decrease in the winter. Because the first graph is cumulative, it does not show just how fast the monthly ridership totals have begun to rebound, since a cumulative tally at the end of a year takes time to reflect what has happened over the course of the year. You can also see the precipitous fall after COVID-19 began. More importantly, this graph allows us to see just how fast the recovery is happening. The seasonal dip from the winter of 2021 into 2022 finished much higher than recent lows, giving a decent ridership base to climb from through the rest of 2022. 

One thing to note from both the first and second graph is that they show a ridership peak around 2015, from which ridership subsequently began a slow decline up to the pandemic. This raises an interesting question that goes unanswered in this data visualization, and for which this dataset, or any dataset, is unsuitable to answer: will a pandemic rebound buck the steady pre-pandemic decrease in ridership, or will it return to where we might have expected ridership to have made a steady decrease to had the pandemic not occurred? Or, ridership could obviously also never rebound to either of those two levels. 

Next, I’m curious about how fast the ridership total tends to increase over the course of the year. That means that for each year, I want a line which at any given month of the x axis shows the running total of ridership up to that point since the start of the year:

![This is a line graph with a line for each year showing the cumulative total ridership over the course of a year](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/114178136/197940555-cb73c1bf-10ab-4e57-8395-1b6fa40c10af.png)

I was unable to add a legend due to the way I had to program it (likely suboptimal), but to explain the coloring, all the black lines are from 2001-2019. The yellow line is 2020. It was going on the same general trajectory as all the previous years, but plateaus right when COVID-19 hit. 2021 is in blue. The trajectory of the 2021 total ridership over the year steadily increases, but its rate of increase is much lower than those of previous years (excluding 2020, of course). Finally, the red line is 2022. Although the red line started the year out with similarly low ridership as the winter of 2021, it is climbing a little faster than in 2021, meaning that more people are coming back to use public transit again. Perhaps something we might see in the near future is the line for each particular year steadily climbing up to where the black lines from pre-COVID ridership years are clustered.

![This is a line graph with a line for each year showing the ridership per month over the course of a year](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/114178136/197940574-ece0f198-18a6-461e-bcb8-df7f9427e7c4.png)

This graph also shows ridership over the course of each year, but rather than showing cumulative counts, it shows the riders each month. The outlook from this graph might make a hope for a speedy public transit ridership recovery doubtful. The red line showing ridership each month for 2022 seems to be flattening out compared to the same line in 2021. When viewed against the pre-COVID lines, this is somewhat typical when only observing the trajectory of the graph, while ignoring the magnitude, as the pre-Covid years seemed to have pretty flat lines as well. However, there is clearly no guaranteed inexorable climb in the recovery, and officials will have to work to encourage the public to utilize public transit again, rather than relying on some sort of natural recovery.

The data visualization did not really find anything particularly new. The conclusions made here by looking at the data visualizations are corroborated by news articles that are already on the Internet. Nevertheless, it helps us visualize in a few ways a lot of the trends that news articles have only described in words. For example, the first article that talks about recent ridership after a simple "CTA ridership” Google search is one by [Streetsblog Chicago](https://chi.streetsblog.org/2022/09/26/some-good-news-about-cta-for-a-change-ridership-has-reached-a-new-pandemic-era-record/), which has data visuals other than a picture of a table. I did not find anything better from all the links of the first page of Google results for that search. So while these graphs do not discover anything new, the media out there for the public to consume very much utilize these sort of graphics, or similar and better ones, so that readers do not have to try and picture what a certain percentage increase or decrease might look like.
